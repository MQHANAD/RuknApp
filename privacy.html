    <h1>Privacy Policy — RuknApp</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>September 22, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Stop guessing. Start growing. RuknApp helps aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners pick the best location using AI and market data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how you can manage your data.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the information we need to provide the app and improve it. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> email address, display name, and any profile information you provide when you sign up.</li>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> approximate location (when you allow location access) to show nearby places and analyze market areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> analytics, crash reports, and performance data (what pages you visit, features you use) to improve the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Content you provide:</strong> any text, photos or notes you add while using the app (for example saved places or notes about a location).</li>
      <li><strong>Device data:</strong> basic device and OS information needed for diagnostics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the RuknApp features (search, maps, AI analysis).</li>
      <li>Run AI-based market analysis to help predict business success in a location.</li>
      <li>Send important account messages and support replies (we do not send marketing unless you opt-in).</li>
      <li>Improve and personalize the app experience through analytics.</li>
      <li>Detect and prevent abuse and protect the security of our service.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Location & AI features</h2>
    <p>RuknApp can access approximate device location if you grant permission. Location data is used to show nearby places and feed our AI models that analyze market factors. You can disable location access in your device settings — some features may not work without it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Sharing and third parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share data with service providers who help operate the app, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> used for authentication and database storage (we store account and app data there).</li>
      <li>Analytics providers and crash-reporting tools that help us improve performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All third-party providers are contractually required to protect your data and use it only to provide services to us.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data from unauthorized access and misuse. However, no system is completely secure — please take care with sensitive information and use a strong password for your account.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We keep your account and app data for as long as you have an account or as needed to provide the service. If you request deletion of your account, we will remove your personal data from active systems within a reasonable time, while keeping minimal records only if required by law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Your choices & rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access & update:</strong> you can view or update your account information in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete account:</strong> you may request account deletion by contacting us (see Contact below).</li>
      <li><strong>Location permission:</strong> you can turn off location permission in your device settings; features that require location will be limited.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>RuknApp is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child under 13 provided us with personal data, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy here with a new "Last updated" date. Significant changes will be communicated through the app or by email if you have an account.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
